# Not-Only-Algorithms

Welcome to the **Not-Only-Algorithms** repository! This is a comprehensive collection of implementations for a wide variety of algorithms and data structures, along with a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, and solutions to common algorithmic assignments, all in Python 3. Whether you're a student, educator, professional developer, or an enthusiast in the realms of computer science and machine learning, this repository is crafted to offer valuable insights and practical code examples to enhance your understanding and skills.

## What's Inside?

The repository is organized into several key sections:

- **Basic Algorithms and Data Structures**: Dive into classic algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.) and fundamental data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.) implemented in Python 3.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Explore more complex algorithms, including but not limited to dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph algorithms.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: A collection of foundational machine learning algorithms, from linear regression to neural networks, implemented in a clear and educational manner.
- **Algorithmic Tasks**: Solutions to common algorithmic assignments and challenges faced by students and professionals alike. These solutions aim to provide clear explanations and efficient approaches to solve these tasks.
- **Utilities and Helpers**: Utility functions and helper modules that facilitate algorithm implementation and experimentation.
- **Examples and Applications**: Real-world applications and examples demonstrating the use of algorithms and machine learning models in solving problems.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Not-Only-Algorithms** repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/not-only-algorithms.git
```

## Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system
You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to a Section**: Browse the repository's folders to find the section you're interested in (e.g., Data Structures, Machine Learning Algorithms, Algorithmic Tasks).

2. **Read the Documentation**: Each implementation comes with detailed comments and documentation explaining the algorithm, its complexity, and its use cases.

3. **Run the Examples**: To run an example, navigate to the corresponding directory in your terminal and run the script using Python. For example:

   ```bash
   python3 path/to/algorithm.py
   ```
4. **Experiment and Learn**: Feel free to modify the examples, experiment with different datasets or inputs, and use the implementations in your projects.
